# gpx_parser
A parser for GPX files. 
The GPX parser is a step towards building a database for mountainbike trails. At the moment the the parser 
plots a 3D projection of the Longitude, latitude and elevation values in a 3D plot. The data visualisation will later be handled by Javascript and the 3D-plotting is so far only for developing purposes.
